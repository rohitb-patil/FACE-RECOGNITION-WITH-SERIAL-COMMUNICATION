**Project Description
*This project combines three key components:

1 .Facial Recognition Model Implementation: We have developed a facial recognition model to identify individuals.
2 .Python-Arduino Integration via Serial Communication: Python scripts are interfaced with Arduino microcontrollers using serial communication, enabling seamless interaction between the two platforms.
3 .Peripheral Integration with Arduino: Various peripherals such as LCD displays and servo motors are interfaced with Arduino, enhancing the functionality and capabilities of the system.
